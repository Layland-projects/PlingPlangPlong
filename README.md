# PlingPlangPlong

For this task I wanted to demonstrate two approaches:

1. An object approach, at the point of construction it evaluates the input and stores the result within it's instance
2. A static method approach (function) that takes the value as an argument and returns the appropriate string.

I made sure to cover both approaches with the same test cases to prove that they are each others equivalent.

I covered each potential output with 6 test cases with varied values including negatives, totalling 42 tests for each approach.
